# commentWriter
A long time ago in a startup far far away one Dr. Aaron Goldman described to me a theoretical blobstore
backed by comments and messagebord posts. I'm not sure how far I want to take it, but that really
captured my imagination and I'd like to find a way to do that in a way that doesn't rely on 
maintainers/admins just not seeing the massive base64 blobs in the comments/messages.
